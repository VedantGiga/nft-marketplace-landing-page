# NFT Marketplace - Digital Renaissance

## Approach

This project implements a modern NFT marketplace landing page using pure HTML and CSS with a focus on:

- **Clean, semantic HTML structure** with proper accessibility considerations
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for responsive layout management
- **Modern design principles** featuring gradients, custom fonts, and visual hierarchy
- **Component-based styling** for maintainable and reusable code
- **Mobile-first responsive design** ensuring cross-device compatibility

The layout uses a hero section with dual content areas (text/cards on left, visual elements on right) and implements modern web design trends including glassmorphism effects and smooth animations.

## What I Struggled With

- **Complex visual positioning** - Achieving precise alignment of overlapping elements (hand, stone, barcode) in the hero visual section required careful z-index and positioning management
- **Responsive breakpoints** - Balancing the intricate desktop layout while maintaining usability on smaller screens, particularly for the NFT cards grid
- **Font loading optimization** - Managing multiple Google Fonts imports while maintaining performance
- **Cross-browser compatibility** - Ensuring gradient effects and modern CSS features work consistently across different browsers

## Known Issues

- **Image dependencies** - The design relies on external image assets that may not load if files are missing from the `/assets` directory
- **Fixed positioning elements** - Some visual elements use absolute positioning which may not scale perfectly on very large or very small screens
- **Performance considerations** - Multiple font imports and large images may impact initial load times
- **Accessibility gaps** - Some decorative elements lack proper alt text and the color contrast may not meet WCAG standards in all areas
- **JavaScript functionality** - Navigation links and buttons are currently non-functional (HTML/CSS only implementation)

## Future Improvements

- Add JavaScript for interactive functionality
- Implement proper image optimization and lazy loading
- Enhance accessibility with ARIA labels and improved semantic markup
- Add CSS animations and micro-interactions
- Optimize for better Core Web Vitals scores
